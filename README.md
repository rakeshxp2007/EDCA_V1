# Electrical Data Compilation Application (EDCA) V1
## Overview:
This project aims to develop an interactive tool to assist personnel responsible for mitigating fire and flooding emergencies aboard INS Vikramaditya, the Indian Navy's largest aircraft carrier. With over 1000 compartments, housing 2000+ personnel and critical equipment, managing emergencies on Vikramaditya demands quick access to information and efficient decision-making.
## Problem Statement:
•	Fire and flooding are major threats onboard ships, posing significant risks to personnel and equipment.

•	Effective emergency response requires quick isolation of electrical networks in affected compartments.

•	Current information access is limited and inefficient, hindering timely response.

## Proposed Solution:

This interactive tool addresses these challenges by providing:
•	**Secure Access:** Login credentials ensure secure access to information.

•	**On-Demand Equipment Data:** Detailed data on all electrical equipment, including location and specifications.

•	**Network Isolation Roadmap:** Based on the emergency (fire/flooding) and location, the tool suggests an electrical supply isolation roadmap for minimizing damage.


## Benefits:
•	**Reduced Response Time:** Faster access to information and isolation pathways minimizes response times and containment efforts.

•	**Improved Situational Awareness:** Visualizations and detailed data enhance understanding of the situation, leading to better decisions.

•	**Enhanced Safety:** Minimized electrical hazards through network isolation protects personnel and equipment.

•	**Simplified Emergency Management:** Streamlined emergency procedures ensure a coordinated and efficient response.


## User Interface:

•	**Splash Screen:** Presents information about the organization.

•	**Login Form:** Input username and password for secure access.

•	**Search Form:** Search for information based on compartment name, location, lighting & ventilation distribution box number.

•	**Query Form:** View results populated based on search criteria.

•	**Update Form:** Update existing data or enter new information.


## Technical Specifications:

•	Microsoft access with some VBA codes.


## Access Control Credentials:

* Username- **ABCD**/ **abcd**
* Password- **ABCD@1234** /**abcd@1234**


## Project Roadmap:

•	Version 1: User can access existing data and search based on compartment name, location, and equipment details.

•	Version 2: Implement user logins with different access levels for data entry, updates, and corrections.


## Conclusion:

This interactive tool provides an invaluable resource for emergency response personnel on INS Vikramaditya. By facilitating quick information access, suggesting isolation measures, and simplifying emergency procedures, the tool aims to significantly improve response time, enhance situational awareness, and ultimately save lives and protect valuable equipment.
